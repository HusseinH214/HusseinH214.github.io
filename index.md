[Child mortality vs. share in extreme poverty, 2023](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/extreme-poverty-vs-child-mortality?country=AUS~RUS~USA~BRA~IND~NGA)

Child mortality is the share of children who die before reaching their fifth birthday, versus the share of the
population living below the International Poverty Line of $3 per day. This dataset explores the number of child mortality rate in different countries, 
The percent under the international poverty line, and the countries population.

[Death rate from malnutrition](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/malnutrition-death-rates?country=USA~OWID_WRL~OWID_HIC~WB_NA~WHO_AMR)

Estimated death rate from protein-energy malnutrition per 100,000 people. This dataset explores the number of deaths caused by malnutrition across different countries.


[Causes of death in children under five, 1980 to 2021](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/causes-of-death-in-children-under-5?country=~USA)

The estimated annual number of deaths from each cause. Estimates come with wide uncertainties especially for
countries with poor vital registration. 

[Share of population living in multidimensional poverty: urban vs. rural areas](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-population-in-multidimensional-poverty-urban-vs-rural-hot?tab=discrete-bar&time=2003)

Share of population living in multidimensional poverty: urban vs. rural
areas in different countries.

[Number of deaths from natural disasters, 1990 to 2025](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-from-natural-disasters?tab=table&time=1990..latest)

This dataset exlpores the number of deaths caused by different natural disasters in different countries.

## Project Ideas
### Using the Datasets Child mortality vs. share in extreme poverty and Causes of death in children under five:
* Exploring the relationship between child poverty and different causes of mortality in children
  * The idea is to explore how the child poverty rate and the different causes of deaths change based on time, and see if there are any specific causes that follow a trend
* Determine if there are any countries that have a low mortality rate despite having a high poverty rate
* Compare how many died from "Preventable causes" given the poverty rate at the time 
  * This could show how poverty effects getting treated for preventable issues
### Using the Datasets Number of deaths from natural disasters and Share of population living in multidimensional poverty: urban vs. rural areas
* Using Visualizations maybe find the most dangerous, or at risk places to be poor
### Using the Dataset Malnutrition 
* Explore Malnutrition on a global scale over time to see if we're progressing
  * Additionally, it would be interesting to see where we progress has halted or falling behind, and when.
